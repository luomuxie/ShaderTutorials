Welcome to My Shader Journey ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

This repository marks the beginning of a personal voyage through the fascinating world of shader programming in game development. Here, I document my progression from grasping the basics to tackling advanced shader techniques. It's a space where each commit represents a step further in understanding and creativity.

Inside, You Will Find:

Personal Tutorials: Narratives and guides reflecting my journey, lessons learned, and the hurdles overcome. These tutorials range from beginner-friendly introductions to in-depth explorations of complex topics.
Shader Experiments: A collection of my shader experiments. These are not just codes but stories of inspiration, frustration, and triumph.
Community Engagement: While this is a personal record, collaboration and input from fellow shader enthusiasts are welcomed. Itâ€™s through sharing that we all grow.
Resources and References: A meticulously curated list of resources that have illuminated the path for me. Books, websites, and tools that have been invaluable.
Contribution Guidelines:
Engagement is encouraged! Feedback, suggestions for improvements, or sharing your own shader stories are all welcomed. This journey is not just about my growth but about building a community of learners and creators.

Embarking on this shader programming adventure has been transformative, and by sharing this repository, I hope to inspire others and perhaps even guide some through their own journey.
